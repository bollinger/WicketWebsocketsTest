	<h1>Start Web Socket page</h1>

	<div>
		<p>
			Pressing the link redircts to the background web socket page.
			The back ground page waits for a websocket connection, then kicks off a worker thread.
			When the worker thread completes the background page is refreshed to show results.
		</p>

		<p>
			Problem.
			Going directly to the background page works fine.
			Going to the background page via the link does not, seems there are multiple instances.
			The connected message is null when the worker completes (it should not be).
